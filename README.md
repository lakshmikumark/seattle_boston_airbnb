## The motivation for the project:

As part of Udacity Data Science Nano degree program, I worked on analyzing Airbnb data for Seattle and Boston cities. This project became more interesting after each data analysis, and the results would help homeowners and the customers to make better decisions.


## The files in the repository:

seattle_boston_airbnb.ipynb - Jupyter notebook that has all the code for this project.

sea_reviews, sea_listings, sea_calendar - Seattle airbnb files

bos_reviews, bos_listings, bos_calendar - Boston airbnb files

## Summary of the results of the analysis:
I analyzed Airbnb data of Seattle and Boston for below questions:

What is the most popular time of the year? - Seattle is busier in summer and Boston is in fall.

How are the prices for different properties? - Boats are most expensive in both cities, followed by loft, houses and apartments. 

How do the prices vary during the year? - Prices increase over the weekend in both Seattle and Boston. Prices are more in summer in Seattle, and they are more in fall in Boston.

How responsive are the hosts? - Most of the homeowners respond within an hour to within a day.

What factors affect the price in future? - Bathrooms, bedrooms, cleaning_fee, security_deposit, number of reviews.
